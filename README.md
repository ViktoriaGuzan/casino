# Awesome cassino app

This is an awesome casino app!
Use `npm start` to run Cassino and enjoy.

TODO:

1. Get the repository, try to launch it locally
2. Write down manual test cases (in this repository, a spreadsheet, wherever you feel comfortable). Level of detail for test scenarios is up to you - maybe just the headline or some highlight is enough to perform the test, or maybe it needs very detailed steps, you decide.
3. Automate some tests if you know how or just want to try it out for the first time (Cypress, Selenium, Testcafe, etc. - any framework and language you're comfortable with)
3. Provide test results, bugs found, questions, concerns, anything you feel worth mentioning etc.
4. Fix some bugs if you can and want to do it
5. Do anything you feel  you'd do being a QA for this magnificent project

If for some reason you fail to launch the project on your local computer don't worry - there's a hosted version at https://clever-visvesvaraya-ea608e.netlify.app/
